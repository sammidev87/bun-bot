        ðŸŒ¿3. Respect the Staff Hierarchy and Staff Members themselves. Any Trolling, Harassment, Disrespect, etc. will result in our Three Strike System which includes us putting a role on you so you don't slip past us.
        
        ðŸŒ¿4. If you are in Littlespace PLEASE do not venture into our NSFW channels. I will not buy the fact that you cannot control where you click. If you have a CG they are responsible for you at that moment when you go into the server. If I see you in a little space in an NSFW channel you will receive a strike. In addition, if anyone sexualizes little space in any way you will be banned. We do not tolerate DDLG, ABDL, or other little space sexualization. This is a safe space.
        
        ðŸŒ¿5. If any NSFW content or symbolism regarding a minor is found in this server, on a member's pfp or name, that member responsible will also be banned. No minor content at all. P3DOs are not tolerated in the slightest.

        If you and your partner break up I don't care. If you create the drama of any kind due to a breakup or a rejection you will be kicked from this server. Please keep it to yourselves. No witch hunting. No taking sides. I am here to provide a match-making process not be a relationship counselor.
        
        ðŸŒ¿7. If you are a part of my blacklist you will be banned upon arrival.
        
        ðŸŒ¿8. Any minor trying to get in will also be banned - this is a server for adults.
        
        ðŸŒ¿9. Please do not discuss any politics or religion in a biased, hateful way. Have debates, but the moment it turns into a fight it will stop
        
        ðŸŒ¿10. Keep all discussions in their appropriate channels!! Talking about weed, go to our MaryJane Fields, talk about NSFW go to our Jasmine Path, etc.
